# LiviOGame — Interactive Browser Games

## Overview
LiviOGame is a simple interactive gaming website built as part of **RevoU FSSE Milestone 2**.  
The project demonstrates core JavaScript fundamentals through a small collection of browser-based mini games.

The focus of this project is not visual complexity, but **clear logic, interactivity, and proper use of the DOM**.

## Features
- Homepage with navigation to all games
- Three interactive JavaScript games
- Consistent layout and styling across pages
- Simple, readable code structure

## Games Included

### 1. Number Guessing Game
- The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100
- The player has a limited number of attempts
- The game provides feedback (“too high” or “too low”)
- Includes reset functionality

### 2. Rock–Paper–Scissors
- Player selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors
- The computer randomly selects a move
- Game logic is handled using a `switch` statement
- Scores are tracked and can be reset

### 3. Clicker Game
- The player clicks a button as many times as possible within a time limit
- A countdown timer controls the game duration
- The best score is stored using `localStorage`

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** — page structure and content
- **CSS** — layout, styling, and responsive design
- **JavaScript** — game logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling

## Learning Objectives
This project was built to practice and demonstrate:
- JavaScript control flow (`if/else`, `switch`)
- Functions and variables
- Event handling (`click`, `keydown`)
- DOM selection and dynamic updates
- Basic state management in the browser
